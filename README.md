## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Deep dive in Tailwind CSS specially in `<ShareBox>` Component
I using to so much Tailwind CSS with reponsive control (may be have better way to do that).

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documents](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - yah just a documents for telling me how to using Tailwind CSS.
- [Access to all child with Tailwind CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67119992/how-to-access-all-the-direct-children-of-a-div-in-tailwindcss) - definitely it has this command on documents of tailwind itself but lacking of use case.
